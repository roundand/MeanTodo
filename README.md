Operational stuff

Some of the other stuff I'm learning, about git, mongodb and linux

AngularJS
---------

I did the course on http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/

Twitter Bootstrap
-----------------

I'm doing the course at https://coders-guide.com/watch.php?v=53

Version Control
---------------

A very simple workflow

- git status                        # what's changed locally?
- git add <new file name>           # start tracking new file
- git commit -a -m "<message>"      # package a unit of change, including all updated tracked files
- git push origin master            # updates github with all local commits
 
MongoDB
-------

(One day soon mongo will be in a separate container)

- ./c9mongodb                       # start mongodb server instance locally, in C9-compatible mode
